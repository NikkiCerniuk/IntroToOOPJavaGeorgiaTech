Problem Description
Hello, and welcome! Please make sure to read all parts carefully.

For homework 02, you will be creating a calculator that can perform the following operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, and alphabetize. The operations work as follows:

add - takes two integers, adds them together and prints out the result
subtract - takes two integers, subtracts the second entered integer from the first and prints out the result
multiply - takes two doubles, multiplies them together and prints out the result to two decimal places
divide - takes two doubles, divides the first entered double by the second and prints out the result to two decimal places
alphabetize - takes two words (without spaces) and tells which word comes before the other lexicographically
Solution Description
Name your program Calculator.java. It should work as follows:

Print out the list of operations for the user.
Prompt the user to enter an operation. This operation must be processed as case-insensitive.
If the user enters an invalid operation, the program should print the following error message and terminate gracefully.
Invalid input entered. Terminating...
Perform the chosen operation and print the correct output.
If the user is performing an add/subtract operation, prompt the user to enter two integers.
If the user is performing a multiply/divide operation, prompt the user to enter two doubles.
If the user is performing an alphabetize operation, prompt the user to enter two words.
If the user inputs an invalid type (e.g. inputs doubles for add/subtract) for the given operation, print the same error message shown above.
The program should terminate gracefully after the result of the operation is printed.
Note that 0 must not be the divisor if you are dividing. If a 0 is the divisor, print the same error message shown above and terminate your program. For the multiply and divide operations, format your output using printf.

Your program must also have at least one switch statement and one if/else statement.

For the alphabetize operation, you will be using a pre-defined String method (compareTo) that compares two strings lexicographically, and returns an integer depending on which String is larger. If a 0 is returned, both Strings are lexicographically equal. A positive integer is returned if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string, or else the result would be negative. See the example output for how the result should be printed to the user for the cases where Strings are equal.

When prompting for integers, doubles, or Strings, spaces will serve as dividers between the two inputs. Remember that when performing multiply/divide operations on doubles, the answer should only include two numbers after the decimal point.

Example Outputs
User input is bolded. Please make sure to follow the exact formatting as shown below. Note: Your program output should end with a new line. That is, after the last character of the answer or the error message, there should be a \n (you could use println, or print a \n manually - just make sure after the last line with text there is exactly one \n).

Allowed Imports
To prevent trivialization of the assignment, you may only import java.util.Scanner.

Feature Restrictions
There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our auto grader. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

var (the reserved keyword)
System.exit

Grading
Make sure that the output from your program solution match the exact format of the expected output.  If not, you will receive errors from Vocareum.  Also, as mentioned earlier in this course, you should use your local editor and JDK to compose and compile/run/debug your code respectively.  Any errors you may then receive from Vocareum will likely be a mismatch in the assignment specification and your code -- e.g. a having a missing or extra space in your output or not rounding numbers as expected.

Allowed Collaboration
When completing homeworks for CS1331 you may talk with other students about:

What general strategies or algorithms you used to solve problems in the homeworks
Parts of the homework you are unsure of and need more explanation
Online resources that helped you find a solution
Key course concepts and Java language features used in your solution
You may not discuss, show, or share by other means the specifics of your code, including screenshots, file sharing, or showing someone else the code on your computer, or use code shared by others.

The Vocareum (code editor) interface has six main components:

The Files Navigation is in the top left. This lets you choose from multiple available files, in the "work" folder.
The Build / Run button. For all assignments in this course, the build and run button will perform the same action: compile your code and run a file scan. Building and running your code will not count towards your total allowed submission attempts, therefore you are free to build / run as many times as needed.
The Submit button. This will compile your code, grade your assignment, and produce a grading report. We expect that you build or run your code on your local computer/JDK before submitting to ensure that there are no issues that will prevent your code from being graded and that every submission attempt will generate meaningful results. Your local JDK's errors, in some cases, will be even more descriptive than what Vocareum can offer you.
The Reset button. This will revert all your changes and reset your code to the default code template.
The Code Window. This is where you will write your code. Again, We highly recommend copying the starter code and working in your preferred IDE.
The Output Window. This window will appear whenever you build, run, or submit your code and will display the results for you to view.
For additional help, please visit the Vocareum information page located in the course information module!

Submitting
You will submit through Vocareum, which will be loaded in a new window. Edit the .java files, and then submit once you are ready to have your homework autograded. Once it finishes autograding (this may take several minutes - be patient), you can access your report in the details tab. You can resubmit as many times as you want.

Locate the 

It is possible that due to how strict the autograder is with output formatting, several tests fail due to incorrect output. It is OK if your submissions initially fail on most, or even all, tests. Review the expected and actual outputs to understand the difference, and adjust your code accordingly.

The autograder reports output differences in two formats: raw (as the Java strings the autograder compares) and visualized (the output printed, which can sometimes look identical if the only differences are in whitespace). We recommend reviewing the raw output if the visualized output is too long or when the visualized output looks the same for the expected and actual outputs.

If you're having trouble finding the difference, you can use a diff viewer, such as the one in https://www.diffchecker.com/ (you can paste the expected in "original" and actual in "changed", or the other way around, as you prefer).
